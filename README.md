# labels

This repo contains the default labels I use in my repositories.

You can use the
[labels.yml](https://github.com/GaleedGutierrez/labels/blob/main/labels.yml)
file along with
[EndBug/label-sync](https://github.com/EndBug/label-sync) action to copy them
to your repository you can tweak the aliases so that you don't loose your
current tags, but they only get edited.
